Install:
Replace pcm_native.c in linux/sound/core/ folder and rebuild the kernel.

Description:
We only modified "snd_pcm_playback_ioctl1" function to support writing
audio data when its being played on the machine.

If the file "/home/oak/workspace/AlsaThird/preload/start.oak" exists, 
the driver will capture the audio and write it into "/home/oak/workspace/AlsaThird/preload/out.raw".
Otherwise, it will just play the audio normally.
